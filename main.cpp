    INSTRUCTIONS:
    
    PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE TO DEFINE A STRING QUADRATIC MATRIX, IN OTHER WORDS, A nxn MATRIX AND SET THE MATRIX IN KNOWMATRIX FUNCTION.

    INFINITY can be expressed like: "i" or "I"

    IF YOU WANT TO CALCULATE THE MAIN DIAGONAL, WRITE INSTEAD OF "-" A STRING "0"

    -WRITE "min" IF YOU WANT TO CALCULATE THE MINIMUM WEIGTH PATH
    
    -WRITE "max" IF YOU WANT TO CALCULATE THE MAXIMUM WEIGTH PATH
